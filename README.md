# LinuxTools

This is a set of tools I use for personal stuff on my Raspberry Pies. It is very WIP but yet here is a quick description of each of them.

## MediaVault

This is a set of tools to help maintaining a set of Movies and Series folders, typically fed with the contents downloaded via Torrents.

### VaultCleaner

Helps monitoring and maintaining the content of folders containing Movies and Series.

### VaultSearcher

Provides a very simple way to search into the Movies and Series folders.

## Bootstraps

A set of simple commands, shortcuts and aliases to add in one's shell config (e.g. ~/.barshrc)
